HOW TO COMBINE THE HTML PARTS INTO ONE FILE

You have 3 parts to combine:
1. index_improved_part1.html
2. index_improved_part2.html  
3. index_improved_part3_final.html

Steps to create the complete index_improved.html:

1. Open a new text file and name it: index_improved.html

2. Copy the ENTIRE content of "index_improved_part1.html" and paste it

3. At the end of part1, copy the ENTIRE content of "index_improved_part2.html" and paste it

4. At the end of part2, copy the ENTIRE content of "index_improved_part3_final.html" and paste it

5. Save the file as index_improved.html

That's it! Your complete improved portfolio is ready.

Quick Test:
- Open index_improved.html in your browser
- Make sure the CSS link works: <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/index_improved.css">

Files you now have:
âœ“ index_improved.html (the combined file)
âœ“ css/index_improved.css 
âœ“ backup/index_original.html
âœ“ backup/index_original.css
